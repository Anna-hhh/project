                Goal Oriented Academy is an academy where you can learn a lot of exciting things
                about technology. Some examples include web development and game development. Here,
                you will meet many new friends in a friendly environment where everyone is eager to 
                help you.

                Mentors ensure that every student receives the information they are interested in.  
                Our academy also offers constant group projects and daily assignments, which are 
                educational and help anyone learn something new. At Goal Oriented Academy, we also 
                organize live meetups, competitions, and many other activities. The academy gives you 
                the opportunity to find a job, get an internship, and connect with highly motivated students—but you
                also need to put in the effort!  
                I am absolutely sure that once you join this academy, you will no longer be hooked on
                games like Minecraft, Roblox, Fortnite, Counter-Strike, and more. You won't even feel the
                urge to play because your new passion—web development—will take over. However, if you are 
                deeply interested in video games, instead of playing them 24/7, why not learn game development
                and create your own games?  
                Today, GOA is one of the leading educational institutions in Georgia. 
                So what are you waiting for? Join us and find out more!
